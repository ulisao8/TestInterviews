I decided to use swift UI to show a little my skills with the latest. The app has an MVVM architecture pattern with Combine,
however I also added a data provider for the networking layer. 
I integrated some basic unit tests to make them notice a little of these skills and there are some comments and markers in the code for better understanding.
In terms of solid principles, I think I apply single responsibility very well, so as not to have such long classes.
The application also has a cache function to improve performance since when you manage images in tableviews, there are usually performance problems.
